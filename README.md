## Synopsis

This is a very primitive log parser for EverQuest log files. Currently, it reads in a log file and displays information regarding the character that generated the log file.

## Motivation

While playing EverQuest, life sometimes comes up and pulls you away from the computer. In these instances, I end up constantly running back to the computer to ensure that my character has not died andthat no actions are required of me. This simple UI's purpose is 
to aggregate all "important" events into a small interface that I could monitor instead of using VNC to access my entire PC. In the future, I plan on having these status changes broadcast via HTTP so they can be picked up by another WiFi device (an Android phone, 
for example).
